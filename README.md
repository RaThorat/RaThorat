- 👋 Hi, I am a data scientist with experience in the healthcare and research sectors. I have worked on projects involving the use of data science to automate subsidy processes and the application of artificial intelligence techniques, such as natural language processing. I have also served as secretary for the NWO Talent Program Vidi for the Aard and Milieuwetenschappen cluster in 2019 and 2020. Prior to this, I worked as a project manager for a sector overview of higher education in the Netherlands, where I developed relevant indicators for 14 universities in the areas of education, personnel, finance, and research valorization. I have also worked on European projects related to the European Open Science Cloud, and have experience in data management planning and the transition from the "data seal of approval" to the "Core Trust Seal." My doctoral research focused on particle enhanced foam flow in porous media near the critical micelle concentration, and involved statistical methods such as the bootstrap method and non-linear symbolic regression. I have also worked as a materials specialist, writing policy reports on material shortages, and as a project engineer, reporting on new technological developments for existing products. In my previous role as a researcher at the aerospace faculty of the TU Delft, I worked on the development of NiTi Shape memory alloy aluminum composite materials for a desired combination of static strength, damping, and fatigue for aerospace applications.
